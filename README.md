# ðŸŒ¸ Flower Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project builds a deep learning model to classify images of flowers into different categories using a
**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** implemented with **TensorFlow/Keras**. It consists of multiple 
convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction, followed by dense layers for classification.
